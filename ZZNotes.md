Plant Pals - like an offerup, but dedicated to plants!

Were there any team collaborations? 
  - Not on this particular project, but it would not have been possible without the support of my cohort and cohort leader.

What is the project about? 
  - Simply, it's about a space dedicated to those who love plants, but also want to try caring for a variety of plants! Whether its an issue of space, finances, or time it would be wonderful for there to be a place for plant lovers to trade, buy, and sell plants freely. 

Why did you choose this idea? 
  - Initially I truly thought that I just wanted something that I knew I could accomplish. As I started to flesh out this idea, I really began to enjoy the idea of creating a site that is somewhere between and ecommerce and fan site. 

Inspiration that led to the creation of your capstone project?
  - My aunt was actually my original inspiration, she and a few friends started a plant swap, where they would quite literally meet every quarter or so to swap plants with others and also talk about their current favotite hobby. 

Were there industries that you were interested in building out a project for?
  - Not really! Which made brainstorming a little more difficult. I did know that if I had to talk about something consistently for three weeks, I wanted to either be knowledgeable or find joy in whatever project I would be building out. 
  
What was the problem you wanted to solve? Why?
  - The problem I ended up solving is a dedicated space for people to trade plants in. Ultimately it can also be used as a platform to also discuss plant maintence and problems. It can act as a book club specifically for plant lovers.

Go as deep as you can (show some code or info on your development process) 

What Technologies did you use? Why did you choose these? 
  - Keeping in line with what I've been taught in FlatIron, I stayed within the basics of JSX and Rails but also dove a little more into ActiveRecord by ustilizing ActiveStorage to help users upload file images instead of a web http image link. This felt like another necessary basic moving forward, but also still within the realm of theory of what I understand. It hit that sweet spot of familiar enough and still brand new. 

Did you entertain utilizing new technologies in the build out of your project?
  - Web sockets so I can include direct messaging! This is going to be inherent to the application as a whole so I will be adding the messaging feature before deploying the project. With that feature up and running, it empowers the users to connect directly with each other as they trade plants. 

What other add-ons did you want to include and are still working on? 

The Process - Howâ€™d you make it? How does it work? What challenges arose along the journey? Etc.
