Plant Pals - like an offerup, but dedicated to plants!

Were there any team collaborations? 
  - Not on this particular project, but it would not have been possible without the support of my cohort and cohort leader.

What is the project about? 
  - Simply, it's about a space dedicated to those who love plants, but also want to try caring for a variety of plants! Whether its an issue of space, finances, or time it would be wonderful for there to be a place for plant lovers to trade, buy, and sell plants freely. 

Why did you choose this idea? 
  - Initially I truly thought that I just wanted something that I knew I could accomplish. As I started to flesh out this idea, I really began to enjoy the idea of creating a site that is somewhere between and ecommerce and fan site. 

Inspiration that led to the creation of your capstone project?
  - My aunt was actually my original inspiration, she and a few friends started a plant swap, where they would quite literally meet every quarter or so to swap plants with others and also talk about their current favotite hobby. 

Were there industries that you were interested in building out a project for?
  - Not really! Which made brainstorming a little more difficult. I did know that if I had to talk about something consistently for three weeks, I wanted to either be knowledgeable for find joy in whatever my project would be building out.
